Submission (April 13, 2024)

Thank you so much for taking the time and reviewing the CausalGPS 0.4.2 package. In this version upgrade we:

- Provided a heads-up message about changes in the software design that will be implemented in CausalGPS version 0.5.x. Since the package has no reverse dependencies, the transition is expected to be smooth. Version 0.4.x will continue to receive updates based on the current design.


The package tested locally and on rhub and passed all tests and checks successfully.
