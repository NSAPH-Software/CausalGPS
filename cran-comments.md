Submission (May 25, 2023)

Thank you for taking the time to review the CausalGPS ver 0.4.0 package. 

In this version upgrade we:

* `generate_syn_data` supports `vectorized_y` to accelerate data generation.
* `estimate_semipmetric_erf` now takes the `gam` models optional arguments.
* `estimate_pmetric_erf` now takes the `gnm` models optional arguments.
* `generate_pseudo_pop` function accepts `gps_obj` as an optional input.
* The design and analysis phases are explicitly separated.
* `estimate_npmetric_erf` supports both `locpol` and `KernSmooth` approaches.
* There is `gps_trim_qtls` input parameter to trim data samples based on gps values.
* Users can also collect the original data in the pseudo-population object.
* Code of conduct is added.
