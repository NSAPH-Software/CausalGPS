Submission (Feb 15, 2023)

Thank you for taking the time to review the CausalGPS ver 0.3.0 package. 

In this version upgrade we:

- Fixed the failing unit tests that happened because of upgrading the wCorr package. The issue was brought to our attention by Prof Brian Ripley and Paul Bailey (Thanks.) 
- We dropped one of the processing flags, which we gave a deprecation warning in the previous release.


The package passes all tests and checks successfully. Here is a sample of test platforms and environments:

macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra, R-release, brew
Windows Server 2022, R-devel, 64 bit
Oracle Solaris 10, x86, 32 bit, R-release (solaris-x86-patched)
