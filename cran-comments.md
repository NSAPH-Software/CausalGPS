## Resubmission

Thank you so much for taking the time and reviewing the CausalGPS 0.2.5 package. I went through your comments and fixed the problems; here is the list of changes:

* The NOTEs are created based on misspelled words in the DESCRIPTION file. All of them are names, except "pre" in "pre-print". I changed it into "preprint".  

* Fixed the arXiv paper URL (http -> https)
 http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06575 --> https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06575/

* Converted invalid CRAN urls into canonical form:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ranger/index.html --> https://cran.r-project.org/package=ranger
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/logger/index.html -->
https://cran.r-project.org/package=logger

* Fixed "permanently moved" issue with Github actions badge.

https://github.com/FASRC/GPSmatching/actions  --> https://github.com/fasrc/CausalGPS/actions

* I double-checked the possibly invalid file URLs. They are valid; as a result, I leave them as-is. 

Please let me know if I need to take any further action.
