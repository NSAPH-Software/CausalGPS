Submission (September 29, 2023)

Thank you so much for taking the time and reviewing the CausalGPS 0.4.1 package. In this version upgrade we:

- Added more details to the plots.
- Removed unnecessary outcome input in the design stage. 
- Addressed raised notes from CRAN on v0.4.0.

The package tested locally and on rhub and passed all tests and checks successfully.
