Re-Submission (September 29, 2023)

Thank you for the notes. We have removed the computationally intensive vignette and also moved examples to the donttest block. We hope these changes resolve the issues. Unfortunately, we are unable to reproduce them locally or during an rhub check (as they pass successfully), so we could not verify the resolution directly.

Submission (September 29, 2023)

Thank you so much for taking the time and reviewing the CausalGPS 0.4.1 package. In this version upgrade we:

- Added more details to the plots.
- Removed unnecessary outcome input in the design stage. 
- Addressed raised notes from CRAN on v0.4.0.

The package tested locally and on rhub and passed all tests and checks successfully.
