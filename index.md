## Summary

An R package for implementing matching on generalized propensity scores with continuous exposures. We developed an innovative approach for estimating causal effects using observational data in settings with continuous exposures, and introduce a new framework for GPS caliper matching that jointly matches on both the estimated GPS and exposure levels to fully adjust for confounding bias.
